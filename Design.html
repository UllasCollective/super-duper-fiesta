  <h1>Design Page</h1>
  <h4> <a href="HomePage.html">Back</a></h4>
  <hr>

  <h3> Abstract of project </h3>
  <p id="abstract"> The interface I have built for this Midterm is a personal music player.
    On the interface page you will find a couple songs I have produced and used as examples.
  </p><br>

  <h3>Design Goals</h3>
  <p id="goals"> My goals for this application is to build an interface which can be used to upload and store music for producers.
    I hope to make this a website that can hold different user accounts, and be able to remember their songs. I have some ideas about
    the javascript ie. local storage as a function to hold data in the url. (But that'll be version.6)

  <h3> HTML Tags </h3>
  <p> The &lt br &gt tag was used to make space in between different items on the page. </p>
  <p> The &lt audio &gt tag is being used to to give control to the song ie. play, pause, and volume.</p>
  <p> The &lt img src= &gt tag is used to place images into the website. With css, you can resize and place the picture where you want. </p><br>

  <h3> CSS Examples </h3>
  <img src="file:///Users/johnmkreski/Desktop/School%20Stuff/Web_HTML/MidTerm/img/css.png">
  <p> This css code is part of the index page, making the menu open and close over the cover of the page. </p><br>

  <h3>JS Examples </h3>
  <img src="file:///Users/johnmkreski/Desktop/School%20Stuff/Web_HTML/MidTerm/img/js.png">
  <p> This javascript code is used to control the song's playing and pausing.</p><br>

  <h3>Testing</h3>
  <h4>Alpha</h4>
  <p> 1) The song title won't allign with picture. EDIT. I got this header to stay and be in-line with the picture by positioning the header to relative in css. Now when you resize the page, the title will stay.</p><br>
  <p> 2) Can't get my pictures to load on Github. <p><br>
  <h4>Beta</h4>
  <p> 1) I have shown my roomates and some of my peers from class by going through page by page. Most people gave recomendations and compliments. So I took them gratefully. I added some but took note of others. </p><br>
  <p> 2) More interactive menu - Responsive Index Page </p><br>
  <p> 3) Border around songs - Div class with a border </p><br>
